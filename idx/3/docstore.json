Each process serves a different \npurpose, and \nC\nhapter 2, Determining the Need for AIBs or Factfindings, provides \nguidance on selecting which process to utilize. Further, Convening/Initiating Authorities \ncan tailor each of these processes to fit their needs\n,\n \nas discussed herein. \nAIBs and \nFactfindings a\nr\ne both types of administrative investigations which VA \nmay \nutilize and \nrely upon when taking administrative actions, including disciplinary actions under VA \nDirective and \nH\nandbook 5021. (\nSee, e.g., \nCh. 2, § 3(a)). \nAIB\ns\n \nand Factfindings are \nnot \nrequired in \na variety of circumstances. Often, everyday information\n-\ngathering \nprocesses are sufficient to meet VA’s needs. \nAIBs and Factfindings are VA’s primary \ntools when a more systematic and thorough \nanalysis is needed. \n \n \na.\n \nAIB\nS\n \n \nAn AIB is a formal admin\nistrative in\nvestigation. The purposes of an AIB include, but \nare not limited to, ascertaining the facts of an issue or incident; identifying and \ninterviewing witnesses and summarizing and recording their statements; gathering \nmaterial and relevant evidence\n \nneeded to a\nssess an issue; analyzing and assessing \nthe gathered evidence; and, if requested, providing \nr\necommendations. An AIB has \nmore procedural requirements than a Factfinding, which typically results in a longer \ninvestigatory period, but produces a mo\nre substanti\nve investigative report and \nassessment of the issue or incident under review. Interviews for AIBs will\n \ntypically\n \nbe \nconducted under oath\n \nor affirmation\n \nand use court reporters to transcribe most \ntestimony\n.\n \n(\nSee also \nCh. \n6, § 1(b)).\n \nAIB procedur\nes are cover\ned in \nChapters \n3 and \n7. \n \n \nb.\n \nFACTFINDINGS\n \n \nA Factfinding is a less formal administrative investigation. The purposes of a \nFactfinding include ascertaining the magnitude of a problem; \ngathering and \nanalyzing evidence\n;\n \nidentifying and interviewing witnesses\n;\n \nsu\nmmarizing and \nrecording \nwitness \nstatemen\nts; determining whether to initiate more extensive \ninvestigations\n;\n \nand, if warranted, assisting in determining the scope of such \ninvestigation. A Factfinding may result in action meant to remedy the problem \ninvestiga\nted. However, a Factfinding may also res\nult in the need to conduct an AIB \nunder the provisions of this \nh\nandbook. A Factfinding has fewer procedural \nrequirements than an AIB, is generally conducted more quickly, and results in a \nless thorough investigative \nreport and review. Generally, interviews\n \nfor Factfindings \nwill not be conducted under oath. Factfinding procedures are covered in Chapters 4 \nand 8.\n \n ","metadata":{"source":"Handbook_0700_17_Aug_2021.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"CreationDate":"D:20210817161222-04'00'","ModDate":"D:20210817161222-04'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2021-08-17T16:12:22-04:00","xmp:modifydate":"2021-08-17T16:12:22-04:00","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:0B3C02A8-700C-46A1-BEF3-E0AADE3881AE","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:0B3C02A8-700C-46A1-BEF3-E0AADE3881AE"}},"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":9}}}],["9",{"pageContent":"VA Handbook 0700 \n \nAugust 17, 2021\n \nChapter 1\n \n \n7\n \n \n \n4.\n \nRESPONSIBILITIES OF CONVENING/INITIATING AUTHORITIES\n.\n \n \na.\n \nGENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES\n \n \n(1)\n \nConvening/Initiating Auth\norities are responsible for ensuring com\npliance with VA \nDirective 0700, this \nh\nandbook, \nand with other governing laws, regulations or \npolicies in the conduct of AIBs and Factfindings. \nConvening/Initiating Authorities \nshall determine the need for administrat\nive investigations for matters within th\neir \nauthority and whether to initiate an AIB or Factfinding in accordance with \nChapter 2, Determining the Need for an AIB or Factfinding. \n \n \n(2)\n \nThe Convening/Initiating \nAuthority may perform the duties of this \nh\nandbook \nt\nhrough appropriate staff.

However, the more \nrelevant\n \nthe testimony \nis t\no the \nissues of the investigation\n, the more important it is that \nthe testimony be complete and \nreliably documented. Do not allow w\nitnesses to make “off the record” statements, as \nthe goal of any investigation is to gather evidence for use in subsequent pro\nceedings. \n \n \na.\n \nSWORN OR AFFIRMED TESTIMONY\n. \nWitness testimony can be\n \naffirmed or taken \nunder oath. Affirmed testimony is taken under an affirmation stating that the \ninformation provided is true, to the best of the witness’s knowledge and belief, subject \nto th\ne penalties for perjury, before a person authorized to administer\n \noaths. An oath is \nidentical to an affirmation except that it includes the words, “so help me God.”  \nTestimony provided under oath or affirmation is called sworn testimony. There are \nalso uns\nworn declarations under penalty of perjury, described in more det\nail below. \nThese types of testimony are equally reliable. \n \n \nOaths and affirmations for witness testimony (including affidavits) are administered \nby a notary public (which generally would include court reporters) or by any person \ndelegated the Secretary’s a\nuthority to administer oaths under 38 U.S.C. § 5711, \nwhich i\ns delegated to Convening Authorities in VA Directive 0700.

This inclu\ndes written \nstatements, unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury or information \nprovided by witnesses through more informal means, such as emails \ndescribing the issue or incident, as describe\nd below. Witnesses should be \nallowed to review their own tes\ntimony or statements, to submit corrections and \nto explain or supplement their testimony or statements by submitting a \ndeclaration or other form of written testimony.\n \n \nc.\n \nFORMS OF TESTIMONY\n. \nIn an AI\nB, testimony from key or essential witnesses \nshould be trans\ncribed by a court reporter. For Factfindings, testimony is generally \nobtained via witness interviews, which are then reduced to writing. For example, a \nFactfinder can interview a witness, take det\nailed notes and draft the information into a \nwritten form fo\nr the witness to review, correct as needed and sign. Alternatively, \nstatements can consist of written questions for the witness to respond to in writing. \nHowever, that method should only be used w\nhen the information being provided is \nvery straightforward a\nnd will not need follow up or clarifying questions (i.e.\n,\n \nwhen \nasking a subject matter expert to provide information on a policy or technical issue). \nAll documentation of witness testimony is pres\nerved in the investigative file\n \n(\nincluding \ndrafts of witness testimony)\n \nand, if material, attached to the investigati\nve report as an \nexhibit as described in Chapters 7 and 8.\n \n \nThere are several available forms and options for documenting testimony, and \nsam\nples are provided in  Appendix K. The forms of testimony, beginning with the \nmost formal and continuing to the least \nformal, are: \n \n \n(1)\n \nSworn or Affirmed Verbatim Testimony. \nThis is a verbatim record of sworn \ntestimony, also referred to as a transcribed interv\niew. A court reporter \nparticipates\n \nand transcribes the interview. A written transcript is prepared and should be \nprov\nided to the witness to review and submit any transcription corrections (errata \nsheet). This form of testimony should be used in AIBs, parti\ncularly for interviews \nof the most important or material witnesses. As noted above, this is not used in \nFactfindings.\n \n \n(2)\n \nAffidavits. \nAn affidavit is a written statement under oath or affirmation \nadministered by a person authorized to do so. This authorized p\nerson will \ntypically sign the document to affirm that they have observed the witness sign the \ndocument. This form of \ntestimony should be used in AIBs, for less important or \ncollateral witnesses. This is not typically used in Factfindings. (\nSee\n \nAppendix K3)\n.\n \n \n(3)\n \nUnsworn Declarations under Penalty of Perjury. \nThis is a written statement by a \nwitness signed under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 1746. Such a declaration \ncontains a statement signed by the witness that, “I declare (or certify, verify or \nstate) under p\nenalty of perjury under the laws of the United Sta\ntes of America that \nthe foregoing is true and correct.

It is the same as an \nunsworn decl\naration but does not require the witness to sign the statement \nregarding the penalty of perjury. This form of testimony is appropriate for \nFactfindings. (\nSee \nAppendix K1). \n \n \n(5)\n \nSummaries of Witness Interviews.\n \nThis is a written summary of an interview \nconduct\ned by an investigator, which can be compiled based upon the notes of \nanyone present for the interview (i.e.\n,\n \ndesignated notetakers, etc.), which is not \nreviewed or signed by the witness.

These are also used in \nPreliminary Inquiries.\n \n \n(7)\n \nAudio recordings of witnesses, other than those take\nn by court reporters, should \nnot be used as evidence, as written testimony is most efficient for a\ndministrative \ninvestigations. \n \n \nd.\n \nPRELIMINARY INTERVIEWS\n. \nIn some circumstances, it may be beneficial to hold \na preliminary interview with potential witnesses. \nIt can be useful to meet with a \nwitness prior to a transcribed testimonial interview, to determine\n \nthe extent of a \nwitness’s knowledge of material facts, to provide notices, to determine whether the \nwitness will exercise any applicable rights and/or to sch\nedule subsequent \ninterviews. During Factfindings, such a preliminary interview could be used to \nde\ntermine if a full interview \nis \nneeded (i.e.\n,\n \nto assess if the witness has relevant \nknowledge or information). Depending on the complexity of the information \np\nrovided, the preliminary interview may provide a basis for a declaration (or other \nwritten testimo\nny). Preliminary interviews also build rapport, save time and costs \nand reduce digressions in a subsequent testimonial interview. Preliminary \ninterviews may a\nlso obviate the need for more formal transcribed testimony elicited \nby an AIB (i.e., if it becomes\n \nevident the witness has no relevant information). \nPreliminary interviews may not be appropriate if the investigator is concerned \nabout a witness improperly i\nnfluencing the testimony of other witnesses, changing \ntestimony or for other reasons. \n \n \nPreliminar\ny interviews trigger the witness obligations and protections described in \nSection 2 below. \n \n ","metadata":{"source":"Handbook_0700_17_Aug_2021.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"CreationDate":"D:20210817161222-04'00'","ModDate":"D:20210817161222-04'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2021-08-17T16:12:22-04:00","xmp:modifydate":"2021-08-17T16:12:22-04:00","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:0B3C02A8-700C-46A1-BEF3-E0AADE3881AE","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:0B3C02A8-700C-46A1-BEF3-E0AADE3881AE"}},"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":42}}}],["42",{"pageContent":"VA Handbook 0700\n \nAugust 17, 2021\n \nChapter 6\n \n \n \n \n40\n \n \n2.\n \nPROCEDURE FOR WITNESS INTERVIEWS\n.\n \n \na.\n \nWITNESS OBLIGATIONS AND \nPROTECTIONS\n. \nInvestigators are responsible for \naffording witnesses any rights they are entitled to under\n \nlaw, \nregulation, policy or \ncollective bargaining agreements during the investigation, as \nsummarized below. \n(\nSee \nAppendix H; Appendix I).

SUMMARY OF WITNESS OBLIGATIONS AND RIGHTS\n \n \nNOTE\n:  Although VA Directive 0700 and this \nh\nandbook do not establish rig\nhts for \nindividuals with respect to \nadministrative investigations, such rights may be established by \nexternal sources such as statutes, \nregulations, collective bargaining agreements or \ngoverning directives. The following summary of \nwitness obligations and \nrights is provided \nto assist investigators \nin observing\n \nthe rights of witnesses \nand\n \nin\n \ndeal\ning\n \nwith legal issues \nthat may arise during t\nhe investigation. Investigators must \nconsult with OGC if significant \nquestions arise regarding the rights or obligations\n \nof \nwitnesses.\n \n \n1.\n \nDUE PROCESS RIGHTS ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO ADMINISTRATIVE \nINVESTIGATIONS\n \n \nFederal law provides certain due process rights \nto persons in proceedings where important \npersonal \ninterests such as property or liberty are at stake. Because administr\native \ninvestigations are \ninvestigative bodies and do not determine such interests, such rights are \ninapplicable to administrative \ninvest\nigations. The employee, therefore, has no due \nprocess right to advance notice \nor to a notice of charges. \nNor does the em\nployee have a \nright to review or to challenge adverse evidence. If adjudication \nproceedings, such as \ndisciplinary proceedings and appeals, are initiated as a result of an administrative \ninvestigation, any applicable due process rights would \nattach to those\n \nproceedings.\n \n \n2.\n \nVA EMPLOYEES’ OBLIGATION TO COOPERATE\n \n \nFederal \nRegulation\n,\n \n38 C.F.R. § 0.735\n-\n12(b), entitled “Furnishing Testimony,” states \n“Employees will furnish \ninformation and testify freely and honestly in cases respecting \nemployment and\n \ndisciplinary m\natters. \nRefusal to testify, concealment of material facts or \nwillfully inaccurate testimony in connection with an \ninvestigation or hearing may be \ngrounds for disciplinary action. An employee, however, will not be \nrequired to give \ntestimony a\ngainst himself \nor herself in any matter in which there is indication that they\n \nmay be or is involved in a violation of law wherein there is a possibility of self\n-\nincrimination.” T\nhe obligation to furnish information extends to VA records and other \nrecords \nfor which the w\nitness \nis accountable as a VA employee, but might not extend to \nthe employee’s private documents or \ninformation. Refer questions \nregarding the reach of \nthis obligation to OGC. (\nSee \nVA Handbook 0700, Ch. 5, § 2(c)(3) for additional \ninformatio\nn on compelling\n \ntestimony).\n \n \n3.\n \nRIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS REGARDING SELF\n-\nINCRIMINATION\n \n \nIf a witness is compelled to give self\n-\nincriminating testimony in an administrative \ninterview, such \ntestimony (or evidence derived in some way from the testimony) may not \nbe used in any cri\nminal proceeding, because such use would violate the constitutional\n \nprivilege against compelled self\n-\n \nincrimination. “Self\n-\nincriminating” testimony is testimony \nthat could be used to prove criminal charges against the individual testifying. \nIt does \nnot\n \ninc\nlude testimony that could only be used to prove non\n-\ncriminal charge\ns, such as those \nused \nin employee disciplinary proceedings. \nHowever, an employee who is assured the \ngovernment will not make use of the \nemployee’s testimony for criminal prosecution, \nwhich \nrequires approval from a U.S. Attorney, of that employee may be dis\nciplined for ","metadata":{"source":"Handbook_0700_17_Aug_2021.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"CreationDate":"D:20210817161222-04'00'","ModDate":"D:20210817161222-04'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2021-08-17T16:12:22-04:00","xmp:modifydate":"2021-08-17T16:12:22-04:00","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:0B3C02A8-700C-46A1-BEF3-E0AADE3881AE","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:0B3C02A8-700C-46A1-BEF3-E0AADE3881AE"}},"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":86}}}],["86",{"pageContent":"Handbook 0700\n \nAugust 17, 2021\n \n \n83\n \n \nsubsequently \nrefusing to answer questions.

C\nOLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM SUBJECTS OF INVESTIGATIONS\n \n \na.\n \n \nIf an investigator obtains evidence or allegations of conduct that may justify \ndisciplinary or \nother adverse action against an ind\nividual (i.e., a “subject”), they:\n \n \ni.\n \nMust interview the subject abou\nt that conduct and request any material evidence \nthat the \nindividual can provide; and\n \n \nii.\n \nShould do so before seeking other evidence on that matter from third parties, \nto \nthe extent \npracticabl\ne\n \nconsistent with the effectiveness and efficiency of the \ninvestigation.

The \nspecific right of \nfederal employees to union assistance \ndu\nring investigative \ninterviews is provided for in 5 U.S.C. § 7114(a)(2)(B). This statute provides that the \nunion that represents a collective bargaining unit “shall be given the opportunity to be \nrepresented at . . . \nany examination of an employee in the un\nit by a representative of the \nagency in connection with an \ninvestigation if  (i) the employee reasonably believes that \nthe examination may result in disciplinary \naction against the employee; and (ii) the \nemployee req\nuests representation.”\n \n \nUnder case law i\nnterpreting this provision, the union representative in attendance at an \ninvestigative interview may take an active role, which generally includes asking questions \nof \nthe unit employee, assisting the employee in prod\nucing relevant information and \nconsultin\ng with the \nemployee. A union representative is not entitled \nto disrupt an \ninvestigation, to provide answers for the employee being \nquestioned or to attend meetings \nor interviews where the employee is not present. \n \n \nIf a member of a collective bargaining un\nit requests union representation, the investigator \nshould \nsuspend the interview pending resolution of the request; review any applicable \ncollective bargaining \nagreements and contact the Convening/Initiating Authorit\ny for any \nnecessary advice or liaison \nwit\nh the Union. OGC should also be consulted. \n \n \nUnder title 38 U.S.C. § 7422 (b), the collective bargaining rights of \nt\nitle 38 employees are \nnot \napplicable to matters involving (1) professional conduct or competence (i\n.e., direct \npatient care or clinical \ncomp\netency), (2) peer review, or (3) certain pay matters. Therefore, \nt\nitle 38 employees have no statutory right to assistance of union representatives at \ninvestigative interviews involving these types \nof matters. In mos\nt cases, however, \nrepresentation is permi\ntted as a matter of discretion as \ndescribed in VA Handbook \n0700, Ch. 6, § 2.

SAMPLE AIB INVESTIGATIVE REP\nORT \n–\nSUMMARY FORMAT\n \n \nThe following example is based on an imaginary, relatively simple scenario involving \nemployee misconduct\n. \n \n \n(VA Standard Memorandum Format)\n \n \nFrom: \nAdministrative Investigation Board\n \nSubj: Investigative Report into Allegations of Patien\nt Abuse, VAMC Anytown \n \nTo: Director, VAMC Anytown\n \n \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n \n \nI have completed the administrative investigation into allegations of verbal patient abuse \nby VA \nemployee Mr. John Orderly on May 24, 2001, as required by your memorandum \ndated May 3\n0, 2001. \n(Exhibit 1). The initial statement of Mr. Paul Patient, the alleg\ned victim of \nthe abuse, is provided in \nExhibit 2. In conducting this investigation, I obtained sworn \ntestimony from Mr. Orderly, whose \nconduct was the subject of this investigation; \nhis \nsupervisor Ms. Janet Nitingale, who was also an \neyewitness; and Dr. El\nizabeth Proctor, \nthe treating physician. (Exhibits 3, 4, and 5). I obtained \nfurther information from Mr. \nPatient over the telephone, but he refused to sign another statement (\nExhibit\n \n6, Record of \nContact). I also reviewed Mr. Orderly’s OPF. (Exhibit 7). \n \n \nI questioned the four other employees on duty in Ward 3 at the time of this incident but \ndetermined that \nnone of them had information material to this investigation.\n \n \nFINDINGS OF FAC\nT\n \n \n1.\n \nMr. Orderly has been employed by VAMC Anytown as an orderly since Octob\ner 1994. Ms. \nNitingale, RN, has been Mr. Orderly’s supervisor since February 1999. (Exhibit 3, p. 1; \nExhibit 4, p. 1).\n \n \n2.\n \nAccording to Ms. Nitingale, Mr. Orderly has been an average to\n \nabove\n-\naverage worker. \n(Exhibit 3, p. 1). He has not \npreviously received disciplinary action for patient abuse or \nother misconduct. (Exhibit 4, p. 10).\n \n \n3.\n \nDuring his off\n-\nhours in May of 2001, Mr. Orderly was pursuing a nursing degree at the \nUniversity of \nAny\ntown. M\ns. Nitingale permitted him to work on school homework \nduring work hours as long as it \nwas related to his medical duties and did not interfere \nwith his VA work assignments (Exhibit 3, p. 5; Exhibit 4, p. 6).\n \n \n4.\n \nOn May 20, 2001, Mr. Orderly was on duty \nin Ward\n \n3, VAMC Anytown. Mr. Orderly’s \ntour of \nduty was scheduled to end at 7:00 AM. He had a class in Medical Ethics \nscheduled for 8:00 AM. Mr. \nOrderly had an essay due that day for that class, which \nhe was working on when not assisting patients. \nAs Mr. O\nrderly \nacknowledges, he was \nunder pressure to do well on this essay because he was in danger \nof failing the class \nand his grade on the essay was worth 1/5 of his grade for the course. (Exhibit 3, p. 7).\n ","metadata":{"source":"Handbook_0700_17_Aug_2021.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"CreationDate":"D:20210817161222-04'00'","ModDate":"D:20210817161222-04'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2021-08-17T16:12:22-04:00","xmp:modifydate":"2021-08-17T16:12:22-04:00","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:0B3C02A8-700C-46A1-BEF3-E0AADE3881AE","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:0B3C02A8-700C-46A1-BEF3-E0AADE3881AE"}},"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":96}}}],["96",{"pageContent":"Handbook 0700\n \nAugust 17, 2021\n \n \n93\n \n \n \n5.\n \nMs. Nitingale was also on duty at that time, as Duty\n \nNurse \nfor Ward 3. Mr. Patient was in \nroom \n327B recovering from surgery (Exhibit 4, p. 7).\n \n \n6.\n \nMs. Nitingale, Mr. Orderly and others on the ward considered Mr. Patient to be a \n“difficult” patient. \nMs. Nitingale and Mr. Orderly were aware of several specific \ni\nncident\ns in which Mr. Patient had, \nunnecessarily, made work more difficult for the \nstaff. Mr. Orderly had at least once referred to Mr. \nPatient as a “lazy S.O.B” in a \nconversation with Ms. Nitingale. (Exhibit 3, p. 8; Exhibit 4, p. 7).\n \n \n7.\n \nAt about 2:30 AM, M\nr. Patient rang for bedpan removal, and Mr. Orderly arrived shortly \nthereafter. \nMr. Patient was reading a magazine and still sitting on the bedpan when he \narrived. Mr. Orderly asked \nMr. Patient to lift slightly so he could remove the bed\npan. \nMr. Patient re\nplied that he would do so as \nsoon as he finished the article that he had \nalmost finished reading. (Exhibit 2; Exhibit 3, p. 9).\n \n \n11.\n \nApproximately fifteen seconds later, Mr. Orderly asked Mr. Patient to lift again, after \nwhich Mr. \nPatient re\nplied that he would\n \nbe finished “in a minute.” Mr. Orderly then made \nthe statement that is the \nsubject of Mr. Patient’s complaint. The words Mr. Orderly \nused, which are disputed by the witnesses, \nare discussed in Conclusion 1. (Exhibit 2; \nExhibit 3, p. 9).\n \n \n12.\n \nMr. Patient then \nsaid in a loud and accusing voice, “Who are you calling a lazy [or \ncrazy] slob?” or \nsimilar language, which was overheard by Ms. Nitingale. Without \nchallenging the implication of Mr. Patient’s question, Mr. Orderly then said, “just lift \nup \nso I can get the\n \nbedpan,” retrieved the bedpan, and \nleft the room quickly. (Exhibit 2; \nExhibit 4, p. 9).\n \n \n13.\n \nMs. Nitingale \nchecked\n \non Mr. Patient and took his statement, which is included as \nExhibit 2 to this report. Mr. Patient stated at that time that Mr\n. Orderly had just \n“disrespected him” \nby saying, “Move your can, you lazy slob.”  She describes Mr. \nPatient’s manner at that time as angry, embarrassed and annoyed, but rational. \n(Exhibit 2; Exhibit 4, p. 10).\n \n \n14.\n \nMr. Patient was released from VAMC Anytown on May 25, 2001. Dr. \nProctor, his \ntreating physician, stated that Mr. Patient told her at his pre\n-\nrelease review that one \nof the orderlies had called \nhim a disrespectful name, that he had already reported it to \nth\ne Medical Center Director, that he was sure \nthe Director would “\nhave his job,” and \nas far as he was concerned it was a “closed subject.” (Exhibit 5).\n \n \nCONCLUSIONS:\n \n \nCONCLUSION 1: When Mr. Patient continued to read after Mr. Orderly had asked \nhim to “lift \nu\np,” Mr. Orderly reacted by saying\n,\n \n“Move your can, you lazy slob\n,\n” or \nsimilar words, to Mr. \nPatient.\n \nAnalysis\n: Mr. Patient’s sworn account of Mr. Orderly’s conduct, written within minutes \nof the \nincident, is strongly supported by independent evidence and the facts above.

Allegations that Dr. Nicks committed whistleblower ret\naliation \nagainst the VA employee who reported the alleged misuse of the \ngovernment vehicle have \nbeen made to the VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP). \nOAWP asked the Convening Authority to provide a copy of this investigative rep\nort when \ncompleted.

On July 22, 2020, the Convening Authority authorized a 14\n-\nday \nextension of this investigation due to the delay occasioned by this matter. (Exhibit 15).\n \n \nb.\n \nOn \nJune 25, 2020, a representative of the AEIOU Local 1234 requested th\nat the \nunion be allowed to attend certain witness interviews on behalf of the employee who \nreported the vehicle misuse so that the union could assist him in his whistleblower reprisal \nclai\nm. The AIB denied this request after consultation with Labor\n-\nManagem\nent relations \nstaff. (Exhibit 4). \n \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\n \n \n1.\n \nAccording to 31 U.S.C. \n§ 3144, \ngovernment vehicles may be used only for official \npurposes. Generally, transportation of an employee fr\nom his or her residence to his or \nher place of employment is not off\nicial.\n \n \n2.\n \nAn agency head may authorize home\n-\nto\n-\nwork use of a Government vehicle where it is \nrequired for the performance of field work. \nSee\n \n31 U.S.C. § 1344(a), (b)(9); 41 C.F.R. § \n102\n-\n5.40.\n \nAll home\n-\nto\n-\nwork transportation must be approved by the agency head. 31 \nU.S\n.C. § 1344. This authority is non\n-\ndelegable. 31 U.S.C. § 1344(d)(3); 41 C.F.R. § \n102\n-\n5.40. “Field work” means official work requiring the employee’s presence at \nvarious locations o\nther than \ntheir\n \nregular place of work.\n \n \n3.\n \nDr. Christine Nicks is a Staff Physi\ncian in Primary Care. She has held the position \nsince June 2015. As part of Dr. Nicks’ job duties, she has utilized a government vehicle \nassigned to the Musicville VAMC to travel t\no different Community Based Outpatient \nClinics. \nFrom\n \nMay 1, 2020\n,\n \nthrough Ju\nne 15, 2020, Dr. Nicks exclusively used \nMusicville government vehicle number 1 when she used a government vehicle; (Exhibit \n7, pp. 2\n-\n3; and exhibit 5).\n \n \n4.\n \nIn the years 2015 through 2\n020, Dr. Nicks has received training about the appropriate \nuse of a governme\nnt vehicle. Included in the training was information that using the \ngovernment vehicle for local transportation between home and work was prohibited \nunless specifically authorized \nby the Secretary of the VA. (Exhibit 7, p. 7). \n \n \n5.\n \nDr. Martin Hyde has been th\ne Chief of Primary Care since July 1, 2020. Prior to him \nholding the position, there were several Acting Chiefs of Primary Care from January \n2015 until he started in his position. \nHe searched records maintained in Primary Care \nand did not find any authoriz\nation by the Secretary of VA for home\n-\nto\n-\nwork use of a \ngovernment car for any employee of the Primary Care department at any time. (Exhibit \n10, p. 2).\n \n \n6.\n \nDr. Nicks never received per\nmission to drive the government vehicle between her \nhome and work. (Exhibit \n7, p. 8). \n \n \n7.\n \nIn about mid\n-\nApril 2020, Mr. Townshend, the Administrative Officer for Primary Care, \nhad a discussion with Dr. Nicks in which Dr. Nicks expressed that following her div\norce, \nher financial situation had changed significantly.

It was adding to her financial burden. Mr. \nTownshen\nd advised Dr. Nicks that home\n-\nto\n-\nwork use of the Musicville VAMC \ngovernment \nvehicle was authorized by VA policy. (Exhibit 9, pp. 5\n-\n6).\n \n \n \n8.\n \nBetween May 1, 2020\n,\n \nand May 20, 2020, Dr. Nicks used a Musicville VAMC \ngovernment vehicle \nseven \ntimes for local transp\nortation directly from home to duty \nstation, which were 30 miles apart. (Exh\nibit 5 and Exhibit 6).\n \n \n9.\n \nOn about May 20, 2020, after attending a training session presented by a VA OGC \nattorney, Mr. Townshend advised Dr. Nicks that he had been mistaken in his p\nrevious \nadvice\n \nand that the law prohibited Dr. Nicks from using the car for \nhome\n-\nto\n-\nwork \ntransportation. (Exhibit 9, p. 8). During this conversation, Dr. Nicks asked whether she \ncould park the government vehicle at another VA facility and drive it between \nthat \nfacility and her office at the Musicville VAMC, Mr. Townshend told her \nshe could do so \nonly if she had official business at the other VA facility. (Exhibit 9, pp. 8\n-\n9).\n \n \n10.\n \nOn about May 22, 2020, Dr. Nicks directed Mr. Townshend to arrange for a Musicvil\nle \nVAMC government vehicle to be parked at the Studio CBOC, which was 3 mile\ns \n(driving distance) from her home and 20 miles from her Musicville VAMC office. \n(Exhibit 9 pp. 10\n-\n11; and exhibit 6).\n \n \n11.\n \nOn about May 25, 2020, Dr. Nicks started a routine morning t\nelephone conference with \noffice staff from the Studio CBOC. Each workday, Dr\n. Nicks would drive her own car \nfrom home to the CBOC and would begin the workday at the clinic at 7:30 AM by \nholding the telephone conference from a vacant office. (Exhibit 7, p. \n10; Exhibit 11, p. \n3; Exhibit 12, p. 3). After completing the telephone conf\nerence, Dr. Nicks would drive \nthe government vehicle to her Musicville VAMC office. Depending on traffic, this trip \naveraged between 30 minutes and 45 minutes. At the close of her \nregularly scheduled \nworkday, Dr. Nicks would depart her office and return th\ne car to the Studio CBOC in \nthe evening. (Exhibit 7, pp. 12\n-\n13).\n \n \n12.\n \nDr. Nicks testified she \ndetermined\n \nthat starting the workday at the Studio CBOC would \nimprove employee morale. She\n \nsaid there were employee issues present there that \nwould benefit from her physical presence each day. Dr. Nicks did not provide specifics \nabout the morale issues. (Exhibit 7, \np. 14).\n \n \n13.\n \nLevon Robertson, Employee/Labor Relations Specialist, produced the perf\normance \nappraisals of the five Studio CBOC employees for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. The \noverall ratings for all employees were Excellent or Outstanding for each year. (Exhibit\n \n14). Mr. Robertson testified that his department has not received any reports o\nf contact \nor emails indicating morale problems at the CBOC. (Exhibit 13, p. 2).\n \n \n14.\n \nStudio CBOC employees Wilson Redding and Otis Pickett have worked at the Studio \nCBOC since 2015\n \nand 2017, respectively. They both testified that in their respective \nopinions, \nthere have not been morale problems at the Studio CBOC. They consistently \ntestified that the Studio CBOC is a great place to work.

Dr. Nicks testified they ranged \nanywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Mr. Redding and Mr. Pickett testified the \nconferenc\nes seldom lasted more than 10 minutes long. (Exhibit 7, p. 15; Exhibit 11, pp. \n6\n-\n7; Exhibit 12, pp. 4\n-\n5).\n \n \n16.\n \nDr. Nicks repeated the routine described in paragraphs 11 and 12 of this Facts section \napproximately 15 times between approximately May 25, 2020\n,\n \nand\n \nJune 15, 2020. \n(Exhibit 5).\n \n \n17.\n \nOn June 15, 2020, Freddie May, a Health Systems Sp\necialist in Primary Care, notified \nDr. Hyde, the Primary Care Chief, that Dr. Nicks was using the government vehicle for \ncommuting.

Dr. Nicks also did not have authorization from the Secretary of \nthe VA to use the government vehicle between her residence and work (Finding of Fact, \nNos. 5 & 6). Although there was no \nevidence to support the conclusion \nDr. Nicks \nintentionally violated the law, she violated it, nevertheless. She also received training \nabout the appropriate use of the government vehicle on multiple occasions. (Finding of \nFact, No. 4). She should not have \nsolely relied on the advice of Mr. \nTownshend. She \nshould have discussed the matter with her leadership or sought an opinion from OGC. \n \n \nConclusion 2: Dr. Nicks’s use of the government vehicle after May 20, 2020\n,\n \nfrom the \nCBOC to the VAMC was not for offici\nal purposes. The morning telephone \nconferences from the CBOC were a pretext to justify transferring much of her \npersonal commuting burden to the government.

Mr. Robertson, the Employee/Labor Relations Specialist, \nproduced performance appraisals and provided testimony, which indicated there were \nno morale problems. Mr. Pickett and Mr. Redding, who have worked \nat the CBOC for \nseveral years, test\nified no morale problems existed. The AIB concludes Dr. Nicks’ \ntestimony lacked credibility. For her to make such a significant change to her\n \ndaily\n \nwork \nschedule, she should have been able to provide specifics about the p\nurported morale \nproblems. The timin\ng of her decision is also highly questionable. She did not begin \nworking daily at the CBOC until after Mr. Townshend told her the law prohibited her \nfrom using the car for home\n-\nto\n-\nwork transportation; and that she could p\nark the \ngovernment vehicle at a dif\nferent VA facility if she had official business at the other VA \nfacility. (Finding of Fact, No. 9). Weighing all the evidence\n,\n \nthe AIB concludes Dr. Nicks \nparked the government vehicle at the CBOC and then drove it to the\n \nVAMC for personal \nbenefit. The arr\nangement clearly benefited Dr. Nicks personally. By beginning the \nworkday at the CBOC with the conference, Dr. Nicks reduced her commute, a commute \nthat had been causing financial strain for her (finding of fact no. 7).\n \n \nWe conclude that Dr. Nicks’s misuse\n \nof the government vehicle after May 20, 2020\n,\n \nwas \nintentional. She had received updated advice from Mr. Townshend that her use of the \ngovernment vehicle up to that point was not permissible. So, she found a reason \nunsupp\norted by evidence, and to her perso\nnal benefit, to continue using the government \nvehicle in a manner that reduced her commute and personal expenses.\n \n \nNOTE\n: These conclusions were made under a preponderance of the evidence standard of \nproof. Certain adverse\n \nactions may be based upon a differ\nent, and lower, burden of proof, \nsubstantial evidence. Therefore, the conclusions made by AIBs under the preponderance \nof the evidence standard are not determinative in those adverse actions.
